** Dotfiles

~/ is where the â™¥ is

These are my dotfiles for [[https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop][Ubuntu]]. This repo is a work in progress...

** About
I use Cinnamon on Ubuntu Linux but I also experiment with [[https://stumpwm.github.io/][Stump]] Window Manager.

These dotfiles configure my Urxvt terminal, mocp music player and logging
into Stump window manager.
