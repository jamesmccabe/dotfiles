** Dotfiles

~/ is where the â™¥ is

These are my dotfiles for [[https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop][Ubuntu]]. This repo is always a work in progress...

** About
I use Gnome on Ubuntu Linux but I also experiment with [[https://stumpwm.github.io/][Stump]] Window Manager.

These dotfiles configure my Urxvt terminal, git configuration and logging
into Stump window manager. 

My [[https://github.com/jamesmccabe/emacs-config][Emacs]] and [[https://github.com/jamesmccabe/stumpwm-config][StumpWM]] configurations are in their own repositories.
