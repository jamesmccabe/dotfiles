;;; Commentary:

;; This file is my personal StumpWM configuration.
;; It works with StumpWM 1.0.0, sbcl 1.3.1 debian on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
;; See manual at: https://stumpwm.github.io/1.0.0/stumpwm-1.0.0.pdf

;;; Code:

(in-package :stumpwm)

(set-module-dir "/home/jmccabe/stumpwm-contrib/")

;; load modules
(mapcar #'load-module '("ttf-fonts"
                        "swm-gaps"))
;; set prefix key
(set-prefix-key (kbd "C-z"))

;; set font
(set-font (make-instance 'xft:font :family "FreeSans" :subfamily "Regular" :size 10))
