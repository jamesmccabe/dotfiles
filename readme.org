~/ is where the â™¥ is

These are my dotfiles for Linux Mint. This repo is a work in progress...

** About
I use Cinnamon on Linux Mint but I also experiment with Stump Window manager. \\  
I launch Stumpwm by using =Stumpwm.desktop= in =/usr/share/xsessions= to 
call =.xinitrc= which launches Stumpwm. \\
To get the correct Stumpwm icon to appear in Linux Mint's MDM manager, I copy
=stumpwm.svg= to =/usr/share/mdm/html-themes/common/img/sessions=. 
The Login manager gives a choice of =St= to pick from the Desktop icons.
