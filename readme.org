~/ is where the â™¥ is

These are my dotfiles for Linux Mint. This repo is a work in progress...

** About
I use Cinnamon on Linux Mint but I also experiment with Stump Window manager.  
I launch Stumpwm by using =Stumpwm.desktop= in =/usr/share/xsessions= to 
call =.xinitrc= which launches Stumpwm.
