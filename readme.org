** Dotfiles

~/ is where the â™¥ is

These are my dotfiles for [[https://www.linuxmint.com/][Linux Mint]]. This repo is a work in progress...

** About
I use Cinnamon on Linux Mint but I also experiment with [[https://stumpwm.github.io/][Stump]] Window Manager.
  
I launch Stumpwm by using =Stumpwm.desktop= in =/usr/share/xsessions= to 
call =.xinitrc= which launches Stumpwm.

To get the correct Stumpwm icon to appear in Linux Mint's MDM Login manager, I copy
=stumpwm.svg= to =/usr/share/mdm/html-themes/common/img/sessions=. 
The Login manager then gives a choice of =St= to pick from the list of Desktop environment icons.
